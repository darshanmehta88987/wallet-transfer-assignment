# AI Usage Disclosure

This document discloses how AI tooling was used while building this
submission, as required by `ASSIGNMENT.md` → "AI usage".

## 1. Tool

**OpenCode (CLI)** running the `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` model.
**Codex Chatgpt :- after running out of tokens from claude.
**chatgpt, gemini :- after running out of tokens from codex

OpenCode is a terminal-based AI coding agent with tool use (file editing,
shell execution, git operations, web fetches, etc.). It was used end-to-end
for this assignment.

## 2. How I generally use the tool

I follow a strict **plan-then-execute** workflow:

1. **Explore first.** The agent reads the assignment, the existing repository
   skeleton, and any prior design notes I have in the repo. It surfaces
   ambiguities back to me as multiple-choice questions.
2. **Lock decisions in writing.** Before any code is touched, the agent
   produces a detailed implementation plan covering: stack, schema,
   layering, idempotency mechanism, concurrency strategy, test plan, and
   commit granularity. I review and approve (or amend) it.

I treat the agent as a fast, tireless pair, not as an oracle. Every design
decision was deliberately chosen — not "whatever the model wanted."

## 3. Session summary

Below is a faithful summary of the conversation that produced this PR. A
verbatim transcript can be provided on request via email; the key prompts
that drove the work are reproduced here.

### My prompts (verbatim)

1. **Initial prompt.**
   > go through the link https://github.com/Robustrade/walletEntity-transferEntity-assignment/blob/main/ASSIGNMENT.md
   > We will implement the solution !

2. **After the agent fetched the assignment, read the existing repo (which
   already contained a pre-implementation `approach.md` from me, and asked me to lock in
   decisions through a multiple-choice question prompt**, I answered:

   - Stack: **Java 21 + Spring Boot + JPA + Postgres**
     (downgraded to Java 17 by the agent because that was the locally
     available toolchain; called out in the plan)
   - Idempotency: **Separate `idempotency_records` table with cached
     response body**
   - Locking: **READ COMMITTED + `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, sorted lock order**
   - Tests: **Testcontainers Postgres**
   - Currency: **Single currency, no currency column**

- Iterated multiple times over the planned solution before going to the build mode for solution implementation.

3. **After the agent produced the full implementation plan**, I replied:
   > Go ahead !


**The agent generated:**

- All Java source (entities, repositories, service, controller, exception
  handler, DTOs).
- The Flyway migration.
- All 31 tests (4 entity/unit tests, 4 service unit tests, 8 controller
  integration tests, 4 concurrency tests).
- The build configuration (`build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`).
- The documentation (`README.md`, `approach.md`, this file).

4. In post mapping consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE is not needed , since it is by default.
   Dont use keywords for example record.
   @Transactional wont work with private methods, will it ?
5. when i said record, i meant for variable name, not for class conversion to record. Please make the change.
6. transaction wont apply properly since db calls are inside private methods, please fix it.  methods needs to be public.
Also for locking, lets use for update query.

Implemented the layering fix.

I added [TransferRecordService](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferRecordService.java), which owns `TransferRepository`, and updated [TransferService](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java) to persist transfers through that service instead of injecting the repository directly.

Verification: `.\gradlew.bat test` passes, including a fresh `compileJava`.

Moved `TransferOutcome` into DTO response layer at [TransferOutcome.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/dto/response/TransferOutcome.java).

Updated imports in [TransferController.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/controller/TransferController.java), [TransferService.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java), and the concurrency integration test.

Verification: `.\gradlew.bat test` passes.

Done.

I refactored [TransferService.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java) so `createTransfer` is now a small orchestration method and the responsibilities are split into focused private methods: validation, request hashing, walletEntity locking, transferEntity creation, idempotency claim, execution, and outcome finalization.

I also changed:

```java
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
```

to simply:

```java
@Transactional
```

Your instinct was right. `Propagation.REQUIRED` is Spring’s default, and for Postgres the default isolation is already `READ_COMMITTED`, so those parameters were redundant here.

On the lock: yes, we should keep it. The transferEntity logic does a read-check-write on walletEntity balances. Without row-level locking, concurrent debits can read the same balance before either update commits, which risks double-spend/lost-update behavior. The ordered walletEntity locking is also what keeps reverse transfers deadlock-safe.

I also corrected the walletEntity entity comment to match the actual lock mode: [Wallet.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/entity/Wallet.java).

Verification:
`.\gradlew.bat test` passes.
`.\gradlew.bat integrationTest` passes.

Done. Wallet IDs are now `String` end to end.

Changed:
- `wallets.id`, `transfers.from_wallet_id`, `transfers.to_wallet_id`, and `ledger_entries.wallet_id` to `VARCHAR(64)` in [V1__init.sql](./src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql).
- Request DTO now accepts string walletEntity IDs with `@NotBlank` / `@Size(max = 64)` in [CreateTransferRequest.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/dto/request/CreateTransferRequest.java).
- `Wallet`, `Transfer`, `LedgerEntry`, walletEntity repository/service, exception, hasher, and transferEntity orchestration now use `String` walletEntity IDs.
- Tests and docs now use examples like `walletEntity-a` / `walletEntity-b`.

Kept transferEntity IDs as `UUID`, since your request was specifically walletEntity IDs.

Verification:
- `.\gradlew.bat test` passes.
- `.\gradlew.bat integrationTest` passed after the type change.

You’re right about the Spring rule: `@Transactional` won’t be applied to private methods.

In this code, the transactional method is already public: [TransferService.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java). The private methods are just helpers called inside `createTransfer`, so they execute within the transaction that `createTransfer` opened. They should stay private to avoid exposing internal orchestration steps.

I added a short comment above `createTransfer` to make that explicit.

Verification: `.\gradlew.bat test` passes.

</details>

Yep, then we can leave it as-is.

Current behavior is rollback-safe because `createTransfer(...)` is public and annotated with `@Transactional`; once Spring opens that transaction, all private helper calls underneath it participate in the same transaction. The private methods do not need their own annotation.

Done.

I changed the flow so `TransferService` no longer receives or passes around `IdempotencyRecord` entities. `IdempotencyService` now owns that entity and returns an immutable DTO instead: [CachedTransferResponse.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/dto/response/CachedTransferResponse.java).

Also updated [TransferService.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java):
- replay uses `CachedTransferResponse`, not `IdempotencyRecord`
- response caching is done through `idempotencyService.storeResponse(...)`
- `TransferResponse.of(transferEntity)` is gone; it now uses the constructor directly

I kept `IdempotencyRecord.storeResponse(...)` inside the entity because that is a domain mutation on a managed JPA entity. The important boundary fix is that only `IdempotencyService` can call it now, so other services cannot accidentally mutate the entity.

Verification:
- `.\gradlew.bat test` passes
- `.\gradlew.bat integrationTest` passes earlier after the same service-boundary change

Done.

I added Lombok to [build.gradle.kts](./build.gradle.kts) and removed boilerplate getters/setters/constructors where it was safe:

- DTOs: `CreateTransferRequest`, `TransferResponse`, `TransferOutcome`, `ErrorResponse`
- Entities: `Wallet`, `Transfer`, `LedgerEntry`, `IdempotencyRecord`
- Exceptions: `WalletNotFoundException`, `IdempotencyConflictException`

I kept explicit domain constructors where validation/invariants are enforced, and used Lombok for mechanical parts like `@Getter`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, and `@EqualsAndHashCode`.

Also added `final` to constructor parameters in controller/services and method params where touched.

Done.

Updated:
- [TransferRecordService.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferRecordService.java): `save(...)` now returns `TransferResponse`, not `Transfer`, so the service boundary no longer exposes the persisted entity.
- Removed `@EqualsAndHashCode` from entities since nothing currently needs entity equality.
- Replaced `@PrePersist` / `@PreUpdate` timestamp methods with Hibernate:
   - `@CreationTimestamp`
   - `@UpdateTimestamp`

I kept `@NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PROTECTED)` because JPA requires a no-arg constructor, and `protected` keeps it minimally exposed.

Agreed, and fixed.

I removed `TransferRecordService` and folded transferEntity persistence back into [TransferService.java](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java). `TransferService` now owns `TransferRepository` directly, so there’s only one transferEntity service.

Yep, you were right. I removed the extra `@Transactional` annotations from:

- `WalletService`
- `LedgerService`
- `IdempotencyService`

Now the only explicit transaction boundary is [TransferService.createTransfer](./src/main/java/com/kullu/walletEntity/service/TransferService.java), which is the real unit of work. The repository calls inside it participate in that transaction, and Spring Data handles repository-level defaults where needed.
