# Wallet Transfer Service

A reliable walletEntity-to-walletEntity transferEntity service demonstrating safe handling of
**idempotency**, **concurrency**, **ledger consistency**, and **transferEntity state
transitions**.

> Submission for the Robustrade `walletEntity-transferEntity-assignment`.

---

## Quick start

The fastest way to run the service end-to-end is with Docker Compose. The
compose file builds the application image from source (multi-stage Dockerfile),
starts a Postgres 16 container, waits for it to be healthy, and then boots the
Spring Boot app.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That's it. When the logs settle the service is listening on
`http://localhost:8080`.

- **App** → `http://localhost:8080`
- **Postgres** → `localhost:5432` (`walletEntity` / `walletEntity` / `walletEntity`)

Flyway runs on startup and creates the schema. The migration also **seeds two
wallets** (`wallet_1` with balance `10000`, `wallet_2` with balance `0`) so the
sample requests below work immediately against a fresh stack.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down            # stop containers, keep the DB volume
docker compose down -v         # stop containers AND wipe the DB volume
```

## API

### `POST /transfers`

```json
{
  "idempotencyKey": "abc123",
  "fromWalletId":   "wallet_1",
  "toWalletId":     "wallet_2",
  "amount": 100
}
```

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| 201 Created             | First successful execution — transferEntity `PROCESSED` |
| 200 OK                  | Idempotent replay — same key, same payload — original body returned |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | First execution, insufficient funds (transferEntity persisted as `FAILED`, replayable) |
| 400 Bad Request          | Validation error or self-transferEntity |
| 404 Not Found            | Source or destination walletEntity does not exist |
| 409 Conflict             | Same idempotency key reused with a different payload |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Unexpected failure |

Successful body:

```json
{
  "transferId":   "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333",
  "status":       "PROCESSED",
  "fromWalletId": "wallet_1",
  "toWalletId":   "wallet_2",
  "amount":       100,
  "createdAt":    "2026-05-21T10:15:30Z"
}
```

Error envelope:

```json
{ "error": "WALLET_NOT_FOUND", "message": "walletEntity not found: ..." }
```

### Sample walkthrough

The seeded wallets (`wallet_1` = 10000, `wallet_2` = 0) make these runnable as
soon as `docker compose up` is ready.

```bash
# 1. Happy path — first execution, returns 201
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/transfers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"idempotencyKey":"k1","fromWalletId":"wallet_1","toWalletId":"wallet_2","amount":100}'

# 2. Replay — same key, same payload — returns 200 with identical body
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/transfers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"idempotencyKey":"k1","fromWalletId":"wallet_1","toWalletId":"wallet_2","amount":100}'

# 3. Conflict — same key, different amount — returns 409
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/transfers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"idempotencyKey":"k1","fromWalletId":"wallet_1","toWalletId":"wallet_2","amount":200}'

# 4. Insufficient funds — first time, returns 422 with FAILED status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/transfers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"idempotencyKey":"k2","fromWalletId":"wallet_1","toWalletId":"wallet_2","amount":999999}'
```

## Design highlights

The full design rationale is in [`approach.md`](./approach.md). Condensed:

- **Single DB transaction per request** at `READ_COMMITTED`. The transferEntity row,
  both walletEntity updates, both ledger entries, and the idempotency record commit
  together or roll back together.
- **Pessimistic row locking** on wallets via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
  (Hibernate `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` on Postgres). Wallets are locked in ascending
  string id order so reverse-direction transfers acquire the same locks in
  the same order — no deadlocks.
- **Structural guarantees at the storage layer**, independent of application
  logic:
  - `CHECK (balance >= 0)` on `wallets` — cannot double-spend even with a
    buggy service.
  - `UNIQUE (transfer_id, type)` on `ledger_entries` — a transferEntity can produce
    at most one DEBIT and one CREDIT row.
  - `CHECK (from_wallet_id <> to_wallet_id)` on `transfers`.
- **Idempotency** via a dedicated `idempotency_records` table that stores the
  request hash plus the cached response body. Replays return the cached body
  byte-for-byte with HTTP 200. A reused key with a different payload returns
  409.

## Running the tests

```bash
# Unit + service + entity tests (no Docker needed)
./gradlew test

# Integration + concurrency tests against a real Postgres
# (Testcontainers — requires a running Docker daemon)
./gradlew integrationTest

# Everything: tests + integration tests + Spotless (format) + Checkstyle (lint)
./gradlew check
```

### Code quality gates

| Gate | Tool | Config | Auto-fix |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| Format | Spotless | rules inline in `build.gradle.kts` | `./gradlew spotlessApply` |
| Lint   | Checkstyle 10.17 | `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` | manual |

Both run as part of `./gradlew check` and any violation fails the build.
