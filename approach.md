# Wallet Transfer Service — Design Note

- Status: **Implemented**
- Author: Darshan Mehta

This document captures the design that was implemented for the
`POST /transfers` service. The narrative tracks the assignment's evaluation
criteria: schema, transaction strategy, idempotency, concurrency safety, and
testing.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Build a service exposing `POST /transfers` that moves an amount between two
wallets with the following requirements:

- **Idempotent.** A second request with the same `idempotencyKey` returns the
  original response without re-executing side effects.
- **Double-entry ledger.** Every successful transfer produces exactly one
  DEBIT on the source wallet and one CREDIT on the destination wallet.
- **Transfer state machine.** Transfers go `PENDING → PROCESSED` or
  `PENDING → FAILED`; transitions are safe under retries.
- **Concurrency-safe.** Concurrent debits cannot double-spend; concurrent
  reverse-direction transfers cannot deadlock.
- **Cleanly layered.** Controller / service / repository / entity.

---

## 2. Stack

- **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3.3** (web + data-jpa + validation)
- **PostgreSQL 16**, **Flyway** migrations
- **Hibernate** (JPA provider)
- **JUnit 5**, **AssertJ**, **Testcontainers Postgres** for integration tests
- **Gradle 8.10** (Kotlin DSL)

Amounts are represented as `BIGINT` minor units (paise/cents). Single currency,
no FX. Authentication and multi-tenancy are out of scope.

---

## 3. API Contract

**Endpoint** — `POST /transfers`

**Request body**

```json
{
  "idempotencyKey": "abc123",
  "fromWalletId": "wallet-a",
  "toWalletId":   "wallet-b",
  "amount": 100
}
```

Bean Validation:

- `idempotencyKey` — `@NotBlank`, `@Size(max = 64)`
- `fromWalletId`, `toWalletId` — `@NotBlank`, `@Size(max = 64)` string
- `amount` — `@NotNull`, `@Positive` (BIGINT minor units)

**Status codes**

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| 201 Created | First successful PROCESSED transfer |
| 200 OK      | Idempotent replay (cached response returned) |
| 422         | Insufficient funds — transfer persisted as `FAILED`, idempotent retries replay the failure |
| 400         | Validation failure or self-transfer |
| 404         | Source or destination wallet not found |
| 409         | Same idempotency key reused with a different payload, or concurrent duplicate that lost the unique-key race |
| 500         | Unexpected error |

Error envelope: `{ "error": "<CODE>", "message": "<human readable>" }`.

---

## 4. Database Schema

Defined in `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql`.

**`wallets`**

- `id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY`
- `balance BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (balance >= 0)`
- `created_at`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ`

**`transfers`**

- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`
- `from_wallet_id`, `to_wallet_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES wallets(id)`
- `amount BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0)`
- `status VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('PENDING','PROCESSED','FAILED'))`
- `failure_reason VARCHAR(64)`
- `CHECK (from_wallet_id <> to_wallet_id)`
- Indexes on `from_wallet_id` and `to_wallet_id`.

**`ledger_entries`**

- `id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY`
- `wallet_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES wallets(id)`
- `transfer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES transfers(id)`
- `type VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('DEBIT','CREDIT'))`
- `amount BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0)`
- **`UNIQUE (transfer_id, type)`** — a transfer can produce at most one DEBIT
  and one CREDIT row. This is the structural guarantee of the double-entry
  invariant.
- Index on `(wallet_id, created_at DESC)` for transfer-history reads.

**`idempotency_records`**

- `key VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY`
- `request_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL CHECK (char_length(request_hash) = 64)`
- `transfer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES transfers(id)`
- `response_status SMALLINT` — nullable until the original response is
  committed
- `response_body TEXT` — cached JSON body returned on replay; stored as `TEXT`
  rather than `JSONB` so the byte-for-byte representation is preserved (JSONB
  re-serializes on read and can reorder keys)

### Why these constraints matter

Many invariants are enforced **structurally at the DB** so that even a bug in
the service layer cannot violate them:

| Invariant | Guard |
|-----------|-------|
| No negative balance | `CHECK (balance >= 0)` |
| No zero / negative transfer | `CHECK (amount > 0)` |
| Exactly one DEBIT + one CREDIT per transfer | `UNIQUE (transfer_id, type)` |
| No self-transfer | `CHECK (from_wallet_id <> to_wallet_id)` |
| No orphan ledger entries | `FK ledger_entries.transfer_id → transfers.id` |
| No duplicate idempotency keys | `PRIMARY KEY (key)` |

---

## 5. Idempotency Strategy

`request_hash` = SHA-256 over `(fromWalletId | toWalletId | amount)`.

The service flow for each request:

1. `findByKey(idempotencyKey)`:
   - **Record exists** → if `request_hash` matches and `response_body` is
     populated, return the cached body with HTTP 200. If `request_hash`
     differs, throw `IdempotencyConflictException(PAYLOAD_MISMATCH)` → 409.
   - **No record** → proceed.
2. Verify both wallets exist (404 if not). This is done before the transfer
   insert so a missing wallet surfaces as 404 rather than as a downstream FK
   error masquerading as 409.
3. Create the `Transfer` row in `PENDING`.
4. `saveAndFlush` an `IdempotencyRecord` with no response yet. If another
   thread beat us to inserting the same key, the unique-constraint violation
   surfaces as `DataIntegrityViolationException` and is mapped to 409
   `IDEMPOTENCY_IN_FLIGHT` after rollback.
5. Execute the transfer (see §6).
6. Serialize the `TransferResponse` DTO with Jackson and persist it on the
   idempotency record.
7. Return the body to the controller with the appropriate HTTP status.

The cached body is the **exact** JSON returned to the original caller —
replays return that body byte-for-byte (we store it as `TEXT`, not `JSONB`,
specifically to preserve key ordering).

**HTTP status on replay:** The controller always returns 200 on replay,
regardless of the original status (which could have been 201 or 422). The body
still carries the original `status` field (`PROCESSED` or `FAILED`), so the
caller can distinguish outcomes. This is a deliberate convention to make
replays distinguishable from fresh executions on the HTTP layer.

### Insufficient funds is still idempotent

If the source wallet does not have enough balance, the transfer is persisted
as `FAILED` with `failure_reason = INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` and the idempotency
record stores the 422 response. Retries with the same key replay the same 422
deterministically — there is no temptation for the client to keep retrying a
doomed transfer.

---

## 6. Concurrency Strategy

**Isolation:** `READ_COMMITTED`. The critical section is deterministic and
deadlock-free under our explicit lock ordering, so `SERIALIZABLE` is not worth
the `40001` retry loop.

Both wallets are locked in ascending string id order. Two concurrent transfers
`A→B` and `B→A` therefore lock the same two rows in the same order — the
textbook reverse-direction deadlock cannot occur.

**Lock mode:** Hibernate's `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` on Postgres maps to
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`. The lock is intentionally stronger than the default
read so concurrent debits serialize on the wallet row before the balance is
checked and updated.

### Why pessimistic over optimistic locking

The hot wallet in a transfer system is a high-contention row. With optimistic
locking, every concurrent debit on a hot wallet would either retry or fail; the
service would need an explicit retry loop with backoff. Pessimistic locking
serializes the writers behind a queue and keeps the retry logic out of the
application — simpler to reason about and easier to test.

---

## 7. Transfer State Machine

Defined on the `Transfer` entity:

```
PENDING ──markProcessed()──▶ PROCESSED  (terminal)
        ──markFailed(r) ──▶ FAILED      (terminal)
```

Invalid transitions throw `IllegalStateException` at the domain level. Because
the entire flow runs in one DB transaction, `PENDING` is transient on disk for
the happy path — but it is persisted so that future asynchronous workflows
(e.g. external clearing) can extend the model without schema changes.

Retries reuse the idempotency key and therefore never mutate a row that has
already reached a terminal state — the idempotency lookup short-circuits
before any wallet lock is acquired.

---

## 8. Failure Modes

| Failure | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Validation failure | 400, no DB writes |
| Self-transfer | 400, no DB writes |
| Wallet not found | 404, no DB writes (checked before transfer insert) |
| Insufficient funds | 422, transfer persisted as `FAILED`, no ledger entries, idempotency record stored → replayable |
| Same key, different payload | 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` |
| Concurrent duplicate that loses the unique-key race | 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_IN_FLIGHT` (caller should retry) |
| DB unreachable / crash mid-tx | Postgres rolls back; a client retry replays cleanly because the idempotency claim was rolled back too |
| Response lost in flight | Client retry hits the cached idempotency response and gets the original body |

---

## 9. Architecture / Layering

```
com.kullu.wallet
├── controller          // @RestController + @RestControllerAdvice
├── service             // @Transactional orchestration (TransferService)
├── repository          // Spring Data JPA, FOR UPDATE on wallets
├── entity              // JPA entities with domain-level state transitions
├── dto.request         // inbound DTOs with Bean Validation
└── dto.response        // outbound DTOs + ErrorResponse envelope
└── exception           // domain exceptions
```

Layering rules:

- **Controllers** validate, delegate, and map exceptions to HTTP status. No
  business logic.
- **Service** owns the `@Transactional` boundary and is the only place that
  orchestrates idempotency together with transfer execution.
- **Repositories** expose only persistence operations; no business decisions.
- **Entities** carry their own state-transition methods (`markProcessed()`,
  `markFailed(reason)`) so invalid transitions are impossible at the domain
  level.
- JPA entities never cross the controller boundary — DTOs sit at the edges.

## 10. Testing Strategy

Following the assignment's **Red → Green → Refactor** discipline.

### Unit tests (`./gradlew test`, no Docker)

- `TransferTest` — state machine: legal/illegal transitions, validation.
- `WalletTest` — debit/credit invariants, overdraft, validation.
- `LedgerEntryTest` — signed amount, constructor invariants.
- `RequestHasherTest` — determinism and field sensitivity (direction matters).

### Integration tests (`./gradlew integrationTest`, Testcontainers Postgres)

- `TransferControllerIT` — eight HTTP-level behaviours:
  - happy path → 201, balances updated, two ledger entries, ledger zero-sum
  - replay (same key + same payload) → 200, byte-identical body, no extra rows
  - replay with different payload → 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`
  - insufficient funds → 422 + `FAILED` row + idempotency cache
  - insufficient funds replay → 200, identical body
  - self-transfer → 400 `SELF_TRANSFER`
  - missing wallet → 404 `WALLET_NOT_FOUND`
  - validation errors (negative amount, blank key) → 400

### Concurrency tests (`ConcurrencyIT`)

| ID | Invariant under test |
|----|----------------------|
| **C1** | **No double-spend.** 50 threads attempt to debit a wallet funded for exactly 30 transfers. Exactly 30 reach `PROCESSED`, 20 reach `FAILED(INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS)`, final balance is zero, ledger has 60 rows and sums to zero. |
| **C2** | **Idempotency under parallel duplicates.** 100 threads submit the same key simultaneously. Exactly 1 transfer row, 2 ledger rows, and all 100 response bodies are byte-identical. |
| **C3** | **Deadlock-free bidirectional load.** 100 transfers symmetric across A↔B run in parallel. All succeed (no `40P01`), net balance change is zero, ledger zero-sum. |
| **C4** | **Mixed workload invariants.** 80 threads, 40 sharing one key + 40 unique keys → 41 transfer rows, 82 ledger rows, balance equation `balance = initial + Σcredits − Σdebits` holds. |

Each concurrency test asserts both **externally observable** counts (HTTP
status counts, response bodies) and **persisted invariants** (row counts,
ledger zero-sum, balance equation).

**Total: 31 tests, all passing on Postgres 16.**

---

## 11. Tradeoffs & Non-Goals

- **Stored balance** chosen over deriving from the ledger — fast reads, simple
  insufficient-funds check; the ledger remains the audit trail. A
  reconciliation job is out of scope but trivial to add.
- **Pessimistic locking** chosen over optimistic locking (rationale in §6).
- **Synchronous single-transaction workflow** chosen over an async PENDING +
  worker design — simpler to reason about; the schema leaves room to evolve.
- **Cached response body as `TEXT`** rather than `JSONB` to preserve
  byte-for-byte equality across replays.
- **No outbox, no event publishing, no FX, no fees, no holds/reservations, no
  rate limiting, no auth.** All out of scope.
- **Observability:** structured Spring Boot logging exists; metrics and
  request-ID correlation are deferred (assignment's optional enhancements).
